I thought before this class that computer science was just a bunch of tech nerds wizzing out, and like very complicated code, but its way different. Rather than that, its a slow paced, but very effective class. I Expect this class to be just like that, a slow paced introduction into coding. Thing is, i have a slight bit of experience in coding, as i wanted to learn it in my middle school years. Thing is, i obviously dont have the best memory, so i would hope this class would be a good reminder of the basics. Plus, i can have this on a resume, or something of the sort, and itll boost up my credits. Also, just having the general knowledge of cooding would be amazing to have.

i feel like computer science is absolutely changing alot of stuff. without computer science, lots of important jobs, and even some unimportant ones wouldnt be functioning today. i will say, there are the small jobs that dont need compter science to work, but there so small that if it werre just them, the world would go to ruin. for example, if we lose the access to our international space station, for example, alot of bad stuff would happen. not to mention, our core jobs, and really life itself, relies on technology.

Now i am not really the best at making projects. But for a project i would want to do, it would be to find a way to make artificial intelligence to help out our elderly, and disabled. I know thats basically not a problem now, but the way i would  do it would be a little bit different. i would set up an ai system into a building, so that it can track their daily moves, and compare it to past days, and send it to a mobile app. also, it would be able to detect if the person in question gets into any type of harm, and alerts eiither a nearby law enforcement, or a set person. i want to do that becuase i myself have almost lost my grandparents becuase of her not being able to get any assistance after something happened when she was alone. i know that would be able to help not just me, but millions of different people without fully relying on an ai to take care of the person.

I feel like the idea of it is an intresting idea, but i dont think it would be very smart. While i think it would be good for people to get some sort of practice, or get used to it before they go to do the real thing, i feel like it wont be as practical. It would be more beneficial to have them go to the ikea and do it in person, with guidance from another person, and get the experience. If you do it online, youre not gonna get that sort of experience from the job rather than you just going in person and doing it. overall, i think that the time, experience, and familiarity of going in person would be more beneficial than doing it online, though doing it online does have some perks to it.

The phrase 6,7 is a common, non-serious verbal tic students use for a few reasons. It often pops up in class or the halls as a casual, slightly teasing way, usually after someone says something funny or messes up doing something. Its simplistic meaning makes it easier to understand or say. It doesn't have a hidden meaning. people just think the number 67 is funny. 67

Autcraft was basically created because the regular Minecraft servers were often super toxic, leaving autistic kids dealing with constant bullying and sensory overload from other players. It solved this by building a dedicated safe space where strict moderation and clear rules actually protect people instead of just letting internet culture run wild. Safe spaces are essential because unmoderated platforms quickly turn into breeding grounds for harassment and hate speech, which can seriously mess with someone's mental health. Developers have a huge responsibility here because they’re the ones who build the architecture of the game; if they don't bake in reporting tools and automated filters from the start, they’re basically leaving vulnerable users to fend for themselves against trolls. When creators ignore safety and inclusion, it usually leads to a race to the bottom where the loudest, most aggressive people take over and everyone else just leaves. Beyond Autcraft, things like Kind Words, or even small, strictly-vetted Discord communities show how design can prioritize kindness over chaos. If developers don't step up, online gaming just becomes another place where people feel like they don't belong.
