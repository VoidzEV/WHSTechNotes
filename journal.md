I thought before this class that computer science was just a bunch of tech nerds wizzing out, and like very complicated code, but its way different. Rather than that, its a slow paced, but very effective class. I Expect this class to be just like that, a slow paced introduction into coding. Thing is, i have a slight bit of experience in coding, as i wanted to learn it in my middle school years. Thing is, i obviously dont have the best memory, so i would hope this class would be a good reminder of the basics. Plus, i can have this on a resume, or something of the sort, and itll boost up my credits. Also, just having the general knowledge of cooding would be amazing to have.
